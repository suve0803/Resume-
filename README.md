Use OS-level APIs to record:
Mouse: Clicks, movements, scrolls (Windows: SetWindowsHookEx, Linux: XLib)
Keyboard: Keystrokes, hotkeys
Store actions as a sequence (e.g., [Click(100,200), Type("Hello"), Press(Enter)]).
Playback Engine

Replay recorded actions programmatically:
Simulate mouse/keyboard events (Windows: SendInput, Linux: xdotool).
Add delays between actions to mimic human timing.
B. Task Scheduling
Cron-like Scheduler

Parse cron syntax (* * * * *) to determine execution times.
Use a priority queue (min-heap) to track upcoming tasks.
Real-Time Triggering

Check for due tasks every minute (via QTimer or <chrono>).
Support one-time and recurring schedules.
C. Scripting & Customization
Script Engine

Allow users to:
Edit recorded actions (e.g., change delays, add conditions).
Write custom scripts (embed Lua/Python or use a DSL).
Variables & Logic

Support if conditions, loops, and external triggers (e.g., run when a file changes).
D. Error Handling & Logging
Recovery

Retry failed actions (e.g., if a window isn‚Äôt found).
Fallback options (e.g., skip or notify the user).
Logging

Log all executions to a file/database (spdlog or QDebug).

Define logical/virtual pages (vector<int> pages)



2. Page Table

Structure to map virtual pages to physical frames

Track: valid bit, frame number, usage (timestamp, access count)



3. Processes

Simulate multiple processes, each with its own page table and page reference stream





---

Step 2: Input Design

Accept the following inputs:

Number of frames

Page reference string(s)

Page replacement algorithm (FIFO, LRU, Optimal, etc.)

Number of processes (optional)




---

Step 3: Address Translation Simulation

Simulate logical address ‚Üí physical address conversion:

int pageNumber = logicalAddress / pageSize;
int offset = logicalAddress % pageSize;



---

Step 4: Page Replacement Algorithms

Implement these in separate functions or classes:
